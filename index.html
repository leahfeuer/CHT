<h3> About Jessica </h3>
<p>I am a licensed psychotherapist in private practice, based in Downtown Brooklyn. I specialize in the treatment of anxiety, depression, perinatal issues, guilt, stress, life transitions, and interpersonal relationships. I also have extensive experience working with adolescents for stress management, coping skills, behavior management and trauma/PTSD.
<p> I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology from Brown University and my Masters degree in Social Work from Columbia University. My approach to therapy is integrative, drawing largely from a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy perspective; however, I individually tailor each treatment plan according to your specific needs.
<p>I appreciate the commitment and energy that it takes to engage in therapy and aim to provide a safe, objective, compassionate, and trusting environment to help individuals improve their lives and maximize their goals. I encourage the exploration of past experiences and current thought patterns. In recognizing how experiences and thoughts inform our moods and behaviors, we can work toward desired change.
